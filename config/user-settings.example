# ODE user settings: the following variables must be set by the user

# (1) the platform to use. this name should have a corresponding
#     makefile.PLATFORM file. currently supported platforms are:
#       msvc		microsoft visual C/C++
#       msvc-dll	microsoft visual C/C++, create a DLL
#       mingw		minimalist GNU for windows
#       cygwin		cygnus GNU for windows
#       unix-gcc	GNU gcc on unix
#       unix-generic	generic unix compiler. you may need to edit the CC
#			variable in makefile.unix-generic
#	osx		Mac OS-X, with the gnu compiler.

PLATFORM=unix-gcc

# (2) the floating point precision to use (either "SINGLE" or "DOUBLE")

#PRECISION=SINGLE
PRECISION=DOUBLE

# (3) the library type to build (either "debug" if you are doing development,
#     or "release" for the optimized library)

#BUILD=debug
BUILD=release

# (4) if you are using an old version of MS-Windows that has command line
#     length limitations then you will need to set this to "1". otherwise,
#     leave it at "0".

WINDOWS16=0

# (5) ODE's collision system had a major change around 7/Nov/2002. The API of
#     the new code is 99% compatible with the old ... however, some legacy
#     applications may rely on subtle details of the old system. Uncomment
#     this variable if you know you need to use the old code, otherwise
#     leave it commented for all new development.

#ODE_OLD_COLLISION=1
